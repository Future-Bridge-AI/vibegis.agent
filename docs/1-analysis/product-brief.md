# Product Brief: ArcGIS AI Development Assistant

## Vision
Build a Lovable/v0-style AI coding platform that guides users through creating ArcGIS web apps, Experience Builder (ExB) widgets, and ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript implementations with BMAD-structured workflows.

## Problem Statement
ArcGIS developers often struggle to translate GIS requirements into the rigid file structures, Jimu framework conventions, and ExB configuration rules required for production-ready widgets. The learning curve slows delivery and leads to inconsistent widget packaging.

## Target Users
- GIS developers building Experience Builder widgets.
- Teams modernizing ArcGIS apps with React 19 and ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript.
- Technical leads who need consistent widget packaging and i18n compliance.

## Goals
- Provide step-by-step BMAD guidance from discovery to widget generation.
- Generate complete, valid ExB widget packages (manifest, runtime, settings, i18n).
- Offer ArcGIS-specific AI agents and Context7-powered documentation grounding.

## MVP Scope (v0.1)
Deliver a Feature Info Panel widget generator that:
- Connects to a JimuMapView and FeatureLayer.
- Displays selected feature attributes in a styled panel.
- Includes settings for layer selection and field configuration.
- Produces a downloadable widget ZIP ready for ExB Developer Edition.
